This is a read me file. 
There is nothing important here yet.

this is an edit made directly from the github site by clicking "edit" on the file page.
when you do this, and you are editing the file on your local machine, you have to remember to C-x C-v to reload the file from disk after it has been synchronized with the github repository.
